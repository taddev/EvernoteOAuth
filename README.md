Evernote OAuth Evernote Mono GTK# Example
=========================================

Abstract
--------
This is my attempt at an example to show how to use the Evernote Cloud API and its OAuth capability to verify a username and password. This program is written in Mono/C#.

The initial UI design is built in GTK#. This was picked because of its integration into the Mono development environment. Future versions may change to support WinForm so the program is more compatible with C#.

Goal
----
The goal of this program is to help me understand how to programatically handle the Evernote API and correctly process user logins through it.
